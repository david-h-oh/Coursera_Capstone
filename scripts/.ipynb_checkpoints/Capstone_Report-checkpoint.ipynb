Next, I utilized the Foursquare API call to retrieve the list of coffee shops and cafes for each neighborhood.

    "Given the assumption, I needed a dataset with the number of coffee shops and cafes nearby for each neighborhood in NYC. To achieve this I first used the dataset from NYU containing the geographic locations (longitudes and latitudes) of the NYC neighborhoods then made the Foursquare API call to retrieve all venues within the radius of 500 meters of each neighborhood. Once the list of venues were retrieved, the dataset was filtered down to only the venues that were categorized as a coffee shop or a cafe. Lastly, a frequency table of coffee shops and cafes were created for each NYC neighborhood. The neighborhoods with the highest number of coffee shops and cafes were given the label of \"top choice\", ones with the second highest number of venues, \"second choice\", and those with the third highest number of venues, \"third choice\". \n",

Assuming that neighborhoods with high number of coffe shops and cafes is a good indicator for a high demand for caffeinated drinks, I utilized NYU's geogrphic location data of neighborhoods in NYC and Foursquare's venue data to identify NYC neighborhoods that had the highest number of coffee shops and cafes. The results suggest that the neighborhoods near the bottom tip of Manhattan and to the northwest of Central Park are good locations for a coffee shop or a cafe."
